        <h2>Education-</h2>
        <ul>

        <h2>Summary-</h2>
            <p>I have what not everyone is fortunate to have and that's grit, <br />
            perseverance and courage. I'm the type of person that others look at <br />
            and wonder why they do things the way they do. Whenever I fail at <br />
            something or get knocked down, I stay down for a while to think about <br />
            why I was knocked down and then get back up. Whenever I mess up I <br />
            usually smile or laugh it off, but that's because I know how I messed <br />
            up and can't believe that I did in order to better myself. With my new <br />
            aspiring position I will be able to learn more from both my <br />
            accomplishments and failures.</p>
